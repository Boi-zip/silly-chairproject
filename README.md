# Silly chair webshop project

This silly site has been made using Next.js.
Made as a project for school.

### I used supabase for the easiest review implementation, without making a server and still having the benefits of a static page.
### and I used EmailJS to verify E-mails for the reviews

## All pictures are not mine.

### The site of this project is [in here](https://chairwebsite.nl/)
